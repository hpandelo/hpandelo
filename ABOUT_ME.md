## Career

### Young
  * Since young, I was a curious guy about this area,
  * about to discover how the computer works, 
  * how the websites gets online 
  * how to make my own

### The Start
  * I started to learn about programming in **2005** via some PDFs that I've found in internet (Since there was no YouTUBE yet)
  * I've made some simple blogs and a website for my brother's company

### ArchRO
  * But I only started a "real" project in **2009** when I decided to have a **Ragnarok Online Server**
    * The server was in _C++_ 
    * The Dashboards/Control Panels was in _PHP + Javascript/jQuery_
  * Due to financial things I've stopped the project in **2010** to work with **eCommerce** pages
    * Done with _PHP_ by using the _Prestashop_ as base
  * Since I've only got 1 customer (my business model was a bit expensive in this time) and since I was working also outside the area, 
  I've stopped with all in  **2011**

### BSc in Information Systems
  * In **2013** I was back.. I decided to get back to this area and started my graduation

### Jacto/CIAg
  * And in **2015** Is the year that I consider as the **REAL** start of my career, It was when I've joined **JACTO/CIAg**
  * In Jacto I worked with many technologies like:
    * _Javascript + jQuery_
    * _Java_
    * _Android (Native and Hybrid)_
    * _IoT (Arduino/Galileo)_
    * _Data Transmission via Radio (Xbee)_
    * _Bluetooth_
    * _RFID and NFC_
    * Introduced: 
      * **_NodeJS_**
      * **_AngularJS_** (and after the Angular 2)
      * RESTFul architecture

  * But... Since all experiences at Jacto/CIAg was done in _PoC_ or small projects (for internal usage), in **2017** I left the company to join **Daitan**

### Daitan
  * In Daitan, I've got the experience with:
    * Global-Wide softwares
    * Well organized projects with Scrum
    * Global DEMOs
    * Technical Interviews
    * Mentoring of Interns
    * Annnnnd... Legacy sustainability as consequence
  * Worked in 2 big companies
    * 8x8 Inc - Global Cloud Communications - Virtual Contact Center
      * _PHP_
      * _Pure/Native Javascript_
      * _Java & Ruby_
      * _ReactJS_
    * SS8 Networks Inc - Lead in Lawful Enforcement Solutions
      * _Java_
  * I've left Daitan after 4,5 years to dedicate to work with Javascript & NodeJS (Since there was no projects with the technologies that I was hired to work on)
