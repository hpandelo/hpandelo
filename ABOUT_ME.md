## I'm Helcio
  * Software Engineer with over 8 years of Experience in Software Development
  * Father of 3 kids
  * Someone who loves technology, games, and old cars

## Career

### Young
  * Since young, I was a curious guy about this area,
  * about to discover how the computer works, 
  * how the websites get online 
  * how to make my own

### The Start
  * I started to learn about programming in **2005** via some PDFs that I found on the internet (Since there was no YouTUBE yet)
  * I've made some simple blogs and a website for my brother's company

### ArchRO
  * But I only started a "real" project in **2009** when I decided to have a **Ragnarok Online Server**
    * The server was in _C++_ 
    * The Dashboards/Control Panels was in _PHP + Javascript/jQuery_
  * Due to financial things I've stopped the project in **2010** to work with **eCommerce** pages
    * Done with _PHP_ by using the _Prestashop_ as base
  * Since I've only got 1 customer (my business model was a bit expensive at this time) and since I was working also outside the area, 
  I stopped with all in  **2011**

### BSc in Information Systems
  * In **2013** I was back.. I decided to get back to this area and started my graduation
  * Developed as coursework Ideen Healthcare, a platform for Android Wear (Wearable devices/Smartwatches) to detect human falls and health monitoring/logging
    * With mentions in the local press
    * Coursework rate 10/10
    * _Note: Apple did something similar recently, but I did it in 2016_

### Jacto/CIAg
  ##### Jan/2015 - Apr/2017
  * And in **2015** Is the year that I consider as the **REAL** start of my career, It was when I joined **JACTO/CIAg**
  * In Jacto I worked with many technologies:
    * _Javascript + jQuery_
    * _Java_
    * _Android (Native and Hybrid)_
    * _IoT (Arduino/Galileo)_
    * _Data Transmission via Radio (Xbee)_
    * _Bluetooth_
    * _RFID and NFC_
    * Introduced: 
      * **_NodeJS_**
      * **_AngularJS_** (and after the Angular 2)
      * RESTFul architecture

  * But... Since all experiences at Jacto/CIAg was done in _PoC_ or small projects (for internal usage), in **2017** I left the company to join **Daitan**
